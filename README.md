# [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com)
Blueprint (a fork of [Skeleton](getskeleton.com)) just like its predecessor, is responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project with a little twist - Its flexbox-based and SASS built.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details. More to come on this fork.

### Why it's awesome

Blueprint is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS
It uses Flexbox layout.


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

Due to limited flexbox support in older browsers (IE especially).
